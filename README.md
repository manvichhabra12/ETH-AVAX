Banks Smart Contract
Overview
The Banks contract allows users to manage account names and transfer Ether between addresses. It provides functionalities for setting account names, checking balances, and transferring funds securely.

Features
Account Names:
Users can set their account names using the setAccountName(string memory _name) function.
The contract emits a NameUpdate event whenever an account name is updated.

Fund Transfer:
Ether can be transferred between addresses using the transferFunds(address payable _to) function.
A Transfer event is emitted whenever funds are transferred successfully.

Balance Checking:
Users can check their Ether balance using the getBalance() function.

Error Handling:
The contract includes custom error handling for cases like insufficient balance during fund transfers (InsufficientBalance error).

Functions
setAccountName(string memory _name)
Sets the account name for the caller.

Parameters:
_name: New account name to be set.

Requirements:
_name must not be empty.
The new name should be different from the current name to trigger an update.

getAccountName()
Returns the current account name of the caller.

Returns:
string memory: Current account name.
transferFunds(address payable _to)
Transfers Ether to the specified address.

Parameters:
_to: Address to transfer Ether to.

Requirements:
_to must be a valid Ethereum address.
Amount of Ether to transfer must be greater than zero.

Effects:
Emits a Transfer event upon successful transfer.

getBalance()
Returns the Ether balance of the caller.

Returns:
uint256: Ether balance of the caller.

Events
NameUpdate(address indexed account, string newName)

Parameters:
account: Address of the account whose name was updated.
newName: New account name.

Description:
Emits when an account name is successfully updated.
Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 amount)

Parameters:
from: Address sending Ether.
to: Address receiving Ether.
amount: Amount of Ether transferred.

Description:
Emits when funds are successfully transferred from one address to another.

Errors
InsufficientBalance(uint256 balance, uint256 withdrawAmount)

Parameters:
balance: Current balance of the sender.
withdrawAmount: Amount of Ether attempted to be withdrawn.

Description:
Thrown when the sender tries to transfer more Ether than their current balance allows.

Usage
Deploy the Contract:
Deploy the Banks contract to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Rinkeby, etc.).
Interact with the Contract:
Use a compatible wallet or tool (like Remix IDE) to interact with deployed contract functions.
Set account names, check balances, and transfer funds securely.

Considerations
Gas Costs:
Ensure sufficient gas for transactions, especially during fund transfers.

Security:
Validate all inputs and consider edge cases to prevent unexpected behavior.
Manage private keys and account access securely to prevent unauthorized transactions.

Testing:
Thoroughly test the contract on testnets before deploying to mainnet to ensure functionality and security.
